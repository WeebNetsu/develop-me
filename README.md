# Develop Me

This is a website for developers to get ideas for projects that could be very profitable or fun.

Why? When I was just a young lad, I always had trouble finding unique and/or fun projects to do, but no one ever had any ideas that interest me, from this struggle the idea of this website was born, a site where you can easily post and get ideas from others!

### Why should I use it?

#### Why Developers

If you are bored or may want to find an idea that could potentially make you score big, then this site could be the best place to look!

#### Why Non-developers

Maybe you have an idea for an app, bot, website (you name it!) that you've always wanted, or think could be the next big thing, this could be the place to express your idea!

Please note! This is not a hiring platform! Any of your ideas that ends up on this website can be taken by anyone. If that person decides to share the profit or create a team with you, then yay, but no one is obligated to start a project with you in it.
